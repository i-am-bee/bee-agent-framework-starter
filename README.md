# üêù Bee Agent Framework Starter

This starter template lets you quickly start working with the [Bee Agent Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework) in a second.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üîí Safely execute an arbitrary Python Code via [Bee Code Interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter).
- üîé Get complete visibility into agents' decisions using our MLFlow integration thanks to [Bee Observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe).
- üöÄ Fully fledged TypeScript project setup with linting and formatting.

## üì¶ Requeriments

You need to have installed the next tools.

- JavaScript runtime [nodejs > 18](https://nodejs.org/)
- Container system typically [podman](https://podman.io/) or [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Remote [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx) or Local [ollama](https://ollama.com) LLM service
- LLM model [Granite](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite) or [Llama 3.x](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting started

1. Clone this repository or [use it as a template](https://github.com/new?template_name=bee-agent-framework-starter&template_owner=i-am-bee).
2. Install dependencies `npm ci`.
3. Configure your project by filling in missing values in the `.env` file (default LLM provider is locally hosted `Ollama`).
4. Run the agent `npm run src/agent.ts`

To run an agent with a custom prompt, simply do this `npm run src/agent.ts <<< 'Hello Bee!'`

üß™ More examples can be found [here](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/main/examples).

> [!TIP]
>
> To use Bee agent with [Python Code Interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter) refer to the [Code Interpreter](#code-interpreter) section.

## üèó Infrastructure

> [!NOTE]
>
> Docker distribution with support for _compose_ is required, the following are supported:
>
> - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
> - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) - macOS users may want to use VZ instead of QEMU
> - [Podman](https://podman.io/) - requires [compose](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose) and **rootful machine** (if your current machine is rootless, please create a new one, also ensure you have enabled Docker compatibility mode).

## üîíCode interpreter

The [Bee Code Interpreter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter) is a gRPC service that an agent uses to execute an arbitrary Python code safely.

### Instructions

1. Start all services related to the [`Code Interpreter`](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-code-interpreter) `npm run infra:start --profile=code_interpreter`
2. Run the agent `npm run src/agent_code_interpreter.ts`

> [!NOTE]
>
> Code Interpreter runs on `http://127.0.0.1:50051`.

## üîé Observability

Get complete visibility of the agent's inner workings via our observability stack.

- The [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) is used as UI for observability.
- The [Bee Observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe) is the observability service (API) for gathering traces from [Bee Agent Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework).
- The [Bee Observe Connector](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe-connector) is the observability connector that sends traces from [Bee Agent Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework) to [Bee Observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe).

### Instructions

1. Start all services related to [Bee Observe](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-observe) `npm run infra:start --profile=observe`
2. Run the agent `npm run src/agent_observe.ts`
3. Upload the final trace to the `MLFlow` (the agent will print instructions on how to do that).
4. See visualized trace in MLFlow web application [`http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/experiments/0`](http://localhost:8080/#/experiments/0)

> Configuration file is [infra/observe/.env.docker](./infra/observe/.env.docker).
